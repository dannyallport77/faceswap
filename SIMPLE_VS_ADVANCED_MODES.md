# Simple vs Advanced Face Swapping Modes

## 🚀 Simple Mode (Recommended for Most Users)

### What it does:
- **Replace any detected face** with your target person
- **No need for "Person A" training data** - just detect faces automatically
- **Faster setup** - only need training data for replacement face
- **Perfect for most use cases** like celebrity face swaps, personal replacements

### How it works:
1. **Step 1**: Project Setup
2. **Step 2**: Add training videos/images of your **target person** (replacement face)
3. **Step 3**: Add content where you want faces replaced
4. **Step 4**: Processing (extract target faces → train model → convert)
5. **Step 5**: Results

### Example Use Cases:
- **Put your face on a celebrity** in a movie scene
- **Replace any actor** with another actor in videos
- **Personal memes** - put anyone's face on funny content
- **Social media content** - face swap in existing videos

### Why it works without Person A training:
- **Face detection** can find faces automatically without training
- **Modern AI** can detect and align faces in real-time
- **Only replacement face needs learning** for reconstruction

## ⚙️ Advanced Mode (For Power Users)

### What it does:
- **High-quality swaps between two specific people**
- **Bidirectional capability** - can swap A→B or B→A
- **Maximum quality** with custom training for both faces
- **Perfect facial reconstruction** of both people

### How it works:
1. **Step 1**: Project Setup + Mode Selection
2. **Step 2**: Add training data for **Person A** (face being replaced)
3. **Step 3**: Add training data for **Person B** (replacement face)
4. **Step 4**: Add content to convert
5. **Step 5**: Processing (extract both faces → train model → convert)
6. **Step 6**: Results

### Example Use Cases:
- **Movie production** - swap specific actors consistently
- **Historical recreation** - replace historical figure with actor
- **Research projects** - study specific face transformations
- **Professional content** where quality is critical

### Why it needs both training sets:
- **Custom face reconstruction** for both people
- **Higher quality results** with specific facial learning
- **Bidirectional swapping** capability
- **Consistent quality** across different lighting/angles
