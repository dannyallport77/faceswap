Welcome to your Simple FaceSwap demo project! Follow these steps to swap faces.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### 01_source_material/
Put videos or images of **Person A** (the face you want to REPLACE)
- Example: Videos of Actor A, Celebrity A, or Person A
- Tip: 30-60 seconds of video OR 50-100 clear photos

### 02_target_material/  
Put videos or images of **Person B** (the REPLACEMENT face)
- Example: Videos of Actor B, Celebrity B, or Person B
- Tip: 30-60 seconds of video OR 50-100 clear photos

### 03_content_to_convert/
Put the videos or images where you want to perform the face swap
- Example: Movie scene with Person A that you want to replace with Person B
- This is your final output content

### 04_extracted_faces/ 
(Created automatically) - Extracted face images from your source material

### 05_trained_model/
(Created automatically) - Your custom trained face-swapping model

### 06_final_results/
(Created automatically) - Your final face-swapped videos/images

## üöÄ How to Use Simple FaceSwap

### Step 1: Prepare Your Material
1. Find good quality videos/images of both people
2. Place Person A material in `01_source_material/`
3. Place Person B material in `02_target_material/`
4. Place content to convert in `03_content_to_convert/`

### Step 2: Launch Simple GUI
Run: `python launch_simple.py` from the FaceSwap directory

### Step 3: Follow the GUI Steps
1. **Project Setup**: Select this demo folder as your project
2. **Source Files**: Add files from `01_source_material/`
3. **Target Files**: 
   - Training Material: Add files from `02_target_material/`
   - Content to Convert: Add files from `03_content_to_convert/`
4. **Processing**: Click "Start Processing" and wait (can take hours)
5. **Results**: Find your face-swapped content in `06_final_results/`

## ‚ö° Quick Test Example

### Sample Workflow:
1. **Get test videos**:
   - Download a short video of Person A (5-10 seconds)
   - Download a short video of Person B (5-10 seconds)  
   - Download target content with Person A (what you want to convert)

2. **Place in folders**:
   ```
   01_source_material/person_a_video.mp4
   02_target_material/person_b_video.mp4
   03_content_to_convert/scene_with_person_a.mp4
   ```

3. **Run Simple FaceSwap**:
   - Launch the GUI
   - Point to this project folder
   - Add the files from each folder
   - Start processing
   - Wait for completion

4. **Results**:
   - Check `06_final_results/` for your face-swapped video
   - Person A's face should now look like Person B

## üí° Tips for Success

### Source Material Quality:
- **Clear, well-lit faces** are crucial
- **Multiple angles** help the model learn better
- **Similar lighting conditions** between source and target
- **No obstructions** (sunglasses, hands covering face)

### Hardware Requirements:
- **GPU recommended** for faster training (hours vs days)
- **8GB+ RAM** for processing larger videos
- **Several GB storage** for extracted faces and models

### Realistic Expectations:
- **Training takes time**: 12-48+ hours is normal
- **Quality varies**: Better source material = better results
- **First attempt**: May not be perfect, can retrain with more data

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **"No state file found"**: Need to complete training first
- **Poor quality swaps**: Use better source material
- **Training too slow**: Reduce batch size or use GPU
- **Out of memory**: Process smaller videos or reduce resolution

### Getting Help:
- Check the terminal output for detailed error messages
- Refer to SIMPLE_GUI_README.md for more details
- Try the full FaceSwap GUI for advanced options

## üìã Checklist

Before starting, make sure you have:
- [ ] Good quality source material (Person A)
- [ ] Good quality target material (Person B)  
- [ ] Content to convert (videos/images with Person A)
- [ ] Enough storage space (5-10GB+ free)
- [ ] Time to wait for training (hours)
- [ ] FaceSwap environment activated

---

**Remember**: Face swapping is an art and science. Good results require:
1. **Quality source material**
2. **Patience during training** 
3. **Experimentation with settings**
4. **Realistic expectations**

Start with short videos and simple scenarios before attempting complex swaps!
