## COMPLETE ISSUE RESOLUTION SUMMARY

All reported issues have been **FULLY RESOLVED** and verified through comprehensive testing.

---

## 🎯 ISSUES RESOLVED

### ✅ 1. Steps 3 and 4 Showing Same Content (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Tab titles were static but content was dynamic
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic tab title updates with clear emoji indicators
- **Result**: Each step now has unique, descriptive titles

### ✅ 2. Simple Mode Interface Ambiguity (FIXED)  
- **Problem**: Unclear which face was being replaced vs imposed
- **Solution**: Crystal-clear terminology with visual indicators:
  - 🚫 ORIGINAL FACE (face to REMOVE)
  - 🎭 NEW FACE (face to PUT ON others)
  - 📺 Content to Convert

### ✅ 3. Simple Mode Training Material Requirements (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Simple Mode incorrectly required training for face being replaced
- **Solution**: Mode-aware validation - Simple Mode only requires NEW FACE training
- **Result**: Simple Mode workflow is now truly simple

### ✅ 4. Redundant Step 4 in Simple Mode (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Simple Mode showed 6 steps instead of 5
- **Solution**: Dynamic Step 4 creation/removal based on mode
- **Result**: Simple Mode = 5 steps, Advanced Mode = 6 steps
