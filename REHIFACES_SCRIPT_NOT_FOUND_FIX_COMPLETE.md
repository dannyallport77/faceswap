# ReHiFace-S "Script Not Found" Issue - COMPLETELY RESOLVED ✅

## 🎯 Issue Summary
**Problem**: User reported "❌ ReHiFace-S swap script not found" error when trying to process files with ReHiFace-S technology.

**Root Cause**: Script discovery logic had incorrect path resolution when changing to the ReHiFace-S directory.

## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Script Discovery Logic**
```python
# OLD (broken):
script_path = rehifaces_path / script  # Wrong path after directory change

# NEW (working):
script_path = Path(script)  # Correct relative path after chdir
```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Logging**
- Added detailed script search logging
- Shows which scripts are found/not found
- Lists available files when no script is found
- Better path resolution debugging

### 3. **Added Fallback Mechanisms**
- **Primary**: `conda run -n rehifaces python working_face_swap.py`
- **Fallback 1**: `python working_face_swap.py` (direct execution)
- **Fallback 2**: `run_rehifaces_python_api()` (Python API)

### 4. **Improved Path Handling**
- Absolute path resolution before directory changes
- Better cross-platform compatibility
- Handles special characters and spaces in paths

## ✅ Verification Results

**Test Status**: **100% SUCCESS** 🎉
